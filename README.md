This project implements an event-driven pipeline to migrate and keep customer data synchronized from a PostgreSQL database to MongoDB. It uses Kafka and Kafka Connect with Debezium for Change Data Capture (CDC), and a Java application with Quarkus and Apache Camel for message processing and transformation.
